# Course Site Generator

Time worked on: From April 2017 - May 2017

## Description

As taken from the Software Requirements Specification(SRS), the purpose of this application "intends to automate the process of 
building and updating a course Web site in one easy to use tool. The sites produced by this application will look good and will
be customizable in a number of different ways, but will exist within a common site and page structure." 

The application has saving and loading capability, using JSON files to save and load data for the user.  There is also an export 
feature, which is used to export the data to a location that the user provides.  The data getting exported includes 5 JSON files 
holding all of the information that the user provided to the app, the neccessary javascript files, the html/css files, and the 
images that will be used.  These files are the finished product of the application.

I should also note that the JSON files used to save and load the data is different from whats getting exported.  The saving and loading JSON is 1 JSON file that holds all of the information, while the export JSON files are 5 JSON files, each of which hold different information that will later be used in the website.

For more information, check the SRS and SDD.
